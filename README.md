# Task - 1 (Basic_TO-DO LIST)

A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowingusers to create, update, and track their to do lists

# Key Concepts and Potential Challenges:

1. User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, whether it's a command-line interface (CLI).
2. Input Validation: Validating user input to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
3. Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations and provide informative error messages to users.
