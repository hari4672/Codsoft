# Task - 1 (Basic_TO-DO LIST)

A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowingusers to create, update, and track their to do lists

# Key Concepts and Potential Challenges:

1. User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, whether it's a command-line interface (CLI).
2. Input Validation: Validating user input to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
3. Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations and provide informative error messages to users.

# Task - 2 (Basic_TO-DO LIST)

Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. 
Perform the calculation and display the result.

# Key Concepts and Potential Challenges:

1. User Input: Prompting the user to input two numbers and their choice of arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Arithmetic Operations: Implementing functions for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Error Handling: Validating user input to handle cases like division by zero or invalid operation choices.
4. User Interface: Designing a simple and intuitive interface to display prompts and results.
5. Modular Design: Organizing the code into separate functions or classes for each operation to improve readability and maintainability.
6. Input Validation: Ensuring that user input is properly validated to prevent errors and handle edge cases.
7. Division by Zero: Handling the scenario where the user attempts to divide by zero and providing appropriate feedback or error messages.
8. User Interface Design: Designing an interface that is easy to understand and use, especially for users with different levels of familiarity with calculators.
9. Handling Invalid Operations: Dealing with cases where the user enters an invalid operation choice and providing clear instructions or error messages.
10. Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations and provide informative feedback to the user.
